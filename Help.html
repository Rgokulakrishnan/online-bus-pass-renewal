  <h2 style="color:#333399;">What is a Bus Pass ?</h2>
 <i> <p> 
<h4 style="color:#4d7399";>Bus Pass is a card, ticket, or permit entitling the holder to travel by bus, typically for a particular period of time or within a particular area.Depending on the transport network and on how much the pass is used, the pass may offer varying discounts compared with trips that are purchased individually. While transit passes can generally be purchased at full price by anyone wishing to use the services (senior citizens, the disabled, students and some others are often able to get them at a reduced price) many employers, colleges, and universities will subsidize the cost of them, or sometimes the full amount.</h5></i></p></div>

<h1 style="color:#262673";>Is Bus Pass Free?</h1>
<p>
The new academic year has begun but there is no sign of any of the four state-run public transport corporations issuing free bus passes to students. This, despite the previous government’s Budget announcement that 20 lakh students would get travel passes free of cost.<br> 
Chances are that the new government will not implement the previous government’s scheme. And, it appears that the reasons are more financial than political.</p>
